# Network Battleship Game | Linux

## Description
:sparkler: This is a server-client application, which implements classic [BattleShip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) game :ship::boom:. While the server is running, the client is able to connect and choose the playing mode (against another player :two_men_holding_hands: or against the computer bot :computer:). After setting up the battlefield, the game starts. If you destroy every opponent's ship, you win! :trophy:

## Usage
- To build server and client enter `make`
- To run server enter `make run_server`
- To run client enter `make run_client`
